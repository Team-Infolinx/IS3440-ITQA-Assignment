Feature: Remove a Book from the Database
  As an admin or user
  I need to remove a book using the API
  So that I can manage book records or handle errors for invalid deletions

  Scenario Outline: Successfully remove a book based on user role permissions
    Given a book is available with a specific ID and user is authenticated as as "<userRole>" with password "password"
    When the user performs a DELETE operation
    Then the server should return a status code of <statusCode> based on the user role "<userRole>"

    Examples:
      | userRole | statusCode |
      | admin    | 200        |
      | user     | 403        |


  Scenario Outline: Attempt to Remove a Non-Existent Book Based on User Role Permissions
    Given a user with role "<userRole>" is authenticated with password "password"
    When the user attempts to DELETE a book that does not exist
    Then the server should return a status code of <statusCode> based on user role permissions

    Examples:
      | userRole | statusCode |
      | admin    | 404        |
      | user     | 403        |

  Scenario Outline: Attempt to Remove a book with an invalid ID format
    Given for a specific book a user with role "<userRole>" is authenticated with password "password"
    When the user attempts to DELETE a book with an invalid ID format
    Then the backend server should return a status code of <statusCode> based on user role permissions

    Examples:
      | userRole | statusCode |
      | admin    | 400        |
      | user     | 403        |


Scenario: A user attempts to delete a book without being authenticated
    Given a user is not authenticated
    When the user attempts to DELETE a book with ID 1
    Then the server should return a status code of 401


  Scenario Outline: Attempt to Remove a Book Without Passing an ID
    Given User with role "<userRole>" is authenticated with password "password"
    When the user tries to DELETE a book without passing an ID
    Then backend server should return a status code of <statusCode> based on user role permissions

    Examples:
      | userRole | statusCode |
      | admin    | 405        |
      | user     | 405        |
